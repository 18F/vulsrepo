(The scope of this CVE is all affected IPv6 implementations from all vendors.) The security implications of IP fragmentation have been discussed at length in [RFC6274] and [RFC7739]. An attacker can leverage the generation of IPv6 atomic fragments to trigger the use of fragmentation in an arbitrary IPv6 flow (in scenarios in which actual fragmentation of packets is not needed) and can subsequently perform any type of fragmentation-based attack against legacy IPv6 nodes that do not implement [RFC6946]. That is, employing fragmentation where not actually needed allows for fragmentation-based attack vectors to be employed, unnecessarily. We note that, unfortunately, even nodes that already implement [RFC6946] can be subject to DoS attacks as a result of the generation of IPv6 atomic fragments. Let us assume that Host A is communicating with Host B and that, as a result of the widespread dropping of IPv6 packets that contain extension headers (including fragmentation) [RFC7872], some intermediate node filters fragments between Host B and Host A. If an attacker sends a forged ICMPv6 PTB error message to Host B, reporting an MTU smaller than 1280, this will trigger the generation of IPv6 atomic fragments from that moment on (as required by [RFC2460]). When Host B starts sending IPv6 atomic fragments (in response to the received ICMPv6 PTB error message), these packets will be dropped, since we previously noted that IPv6 packets with extension headers were being dropped between Host B and Host A. Thus, this situation will result in a DoS scenario. Another possible scenario is that in which two BGP peers are employing IPv6 transport and they implement Access Control Lists (ACLs) to drop IPv6 fragments (to avoid control-plane attacks). If the aforementioned BGP peers drop IPv6 fragments but still honor received ICMPv6 PTB error messages, an attacker could easily attack the corresponding peering session by simply sending an ICMPv6 PTB message with a reported MTU smaller than 1280 bytes. Once the attack packet has been sent, the aforementioned routers will themselves be the ones dropping their own traffic.","Severity":"","Cvss2Score":5,"Cvss2Vector":"AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:N/I:N/A:P","Cvss3Score":0,"Cvss3Vector":"","SourceLink":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2016-10142","Cpes":[],"References":[{"Source":"BID","Link":"http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/95797","RefID":""},{"Source":"SECTRACK","Link":"http://www.securitytracker.com/id/1038256","RefID":""},{"Source":"MISC","Link":"https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-6man-deprecate-atomfrag-generation-08","RefID":""},{"Source":"MISC","Link":"https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8021","RefID":""}],"CweID":"CWE-17","Published":"2017-01-14T02:59:00.137-05:00","LastModified":"2017-07-10T21:33:22.253-04:00"},"redhat":{"Type":"redhat","CveID":"CVE-2016-10142","Title":"RHSA-2017:0817: kernel security, bug fix, and enhancement update (Moderate)","Summary":"The kernel packages contain the Linux kernel, the core of any Linux operating system.\n\nSecurity Fix(es):\n\n* It was discovered that a remote attacker could leverage the generation of IPv6 atomic fragments to trigger the use of fragmentation in an arbitrary IPv6 flow (in scenarios in which actual fragmentation of packets is not needed) and could subsequently perform any type of a fragmentation-based attack against legacy IPv6 nodes that do not implement RFC6946. (CVE-2016-10142, Moderate)\n\n* A flaw was discovered in the way the Linux kernel dealt with paging structures. When the kernel invalidated a paging structure that was not in use locally, it could, in principle, race against another CPU that is switching to a process that uses the paging structure in question. A local user could use a thread running with a stale cached virtual-\u003ephysical translation to potentially escalate their privileges if the translation in question were writable and the physical page got reused for something critical (for example, a page table). (CVE-2016-2069, Moderate)\n\n* A race condition flaw was found in the ioctl_send_fib() function in the Linux kernel's aacraid implementation. A local attacker could use this flaw to cause a denial of service (out-of-bounds access or system crash) by changing a certain size value. (CVE-2016-6480, Moderate)\n\n* It was found that when the gcc stack protector was enabled, reading the /proc/keys file could cause a panic in the Linux kernel due to stack corruption. This happened because an incorrect buffer size was used to hold a 64-bit timeout value rendered as weeks. (CVE-2016-7042, Moderate)\n\n* It was found that when file permissions were modified via chmod and the user modifying them was not in the owning group or capable of CAP_FSETID, the setgid bit would be cleared. Setting a POSIX ACL via setxattr sets the file permissions as well as the new ACL, but doesn't clear the setgid bit in a similar way. This could allow a local user to gain group privileges via certain setgid applications. (CVE-2016-7097, Moderate)\n\n* A flaw was found in the Linux networking subsystem where a local attacker with CAP_NET_ADMIN capabilities could cause an out-of-bounds memory access by creating a smaller-than-expected ICMP header and sending to its destination via sendto(). (CVE-2016-8399, Moderate)\n\n* It was found that the blk_rq_map_user_iov() function in the Linux kernel's block device implementation did not properly restrict the type of iterator, which could allow a local attacker to read or write to arbitrary kernel memory locations or cause a denial of service (use-after-free) by leveraging write access to a /dev/sg device. (CVE-2016-9576, CVE-2016-10088, Moderate)\n\n* A flaw was found in the USB-MIDI Linux kernel driver: a double-free error could be triggered for the 'umidi' object. An attacker with physical access to the system could use this flaw to escalate their privileges.

kernel security, bug fix, and enhancement update (Moderate)","Summary":"The kernel packages contain the Linux kernel, the core of any Linux operating system.\n\nSecurity Fix(es):\n\n* It was discovered that a remote attacker could leverage the generation of IPv6 atomic fragments to trigger the use of fragmentation in an arbitrary IPv6 flow (in scenarios in which actual fragmentation of packets is not needed) and could subsequently perform any type of a fragmentation-based attack against legacy IPv6 nodes that do not implement RFC6946. (CVE-2016-10142, Moderate)\n\n* A flaw was discovered in the way the Linux kernel dealt with paging structures. When the kernel invalidated a paging structure that was not in use locally, it could, in principle, race against another CPU that is switching to a process that uses the paging structure in question. A local user could use a thread running with a stale cached virtual-\u003ephysical translation to potentially escalate their privileges if the translation in question were writable and the physical page got reused for something critical (for example, a page table). (CVE-2016-2069, Moderate)\n\n* A race condition flaw was found in the ioctl_send_fib() function in the Linux kernel's aacraid implementation. A local attacker could use this flaw to cause a denial of service (out-of-bounds access or system crash) by changing a certain size value. (CVE-2016-6480, Moderate)\n\n* It was found that when the gcc stack protector was enabled, reading the /proc/keys file could cause a panic in the Linux kernel due to stack corruption. This happened because an incorrect buffer size was used to hold a 64-bit timeout value rendered as weeks. (CVE-2016-7042, Moderate)\n\n* It was found that when file permissions were modified via chmod and the user modifying them was not in the owning group or capable of CAP_FSETID, the setgid bit would be cleared. Setting a POSIX ACL via setxattr sets the file permissions as well as the new ACL, but doesn't clear the setgid bit in a similar way. This could allow a local user to gain group privileges via certain setgid applications. (CVE-2016-7097, Moderate)\n\n* A flaw was found in the Linux networking subsystem where a local attacker with CAP_NET_ADMIN capabilities could cause an out-of-bounds memory access by creating a smaller-than-expected ICMP header and sending to its destination via sendto(). (CVE-2016-8399, Moderate)\n\n* It was found that the blk_rq_map_user_iov() function in the Linux kernel's block device implementation did not properly restrict the type of iterator, which could allow a local attacker to read or write to arbitrary kernel memory locations or cause a denial of service (use-after-free) by leveraging write access to a /dev/sg device. (CVE-2016-9576, CVE-2016-10088, Moderate)\n\n* A flaw was found in the USB-MIDI Linux kernel driver: a double-free error could be triggered for the 'umidi' object.

These packages include the ntpd service which continuously adjusts system time and utilities used to query and configure the ntpd service.\n\nSecurity Fix(es):\n\n* It was found that when NTP was configured in broadcast mode, a remote attacker could broadcast packets with bad authentication to all clients. The clients, upon receiving the malformed packets, would break the association with the broadcast server, causing them to become out of sync over a longer period of time. (CVE-2015-7979)\n\n* A denial of service flaw was found in the way NTP handled preemptable client associations. A remote attacker could send several crypto NAK packets to a victim client, each with a spoofed source address of an existing associated peer, preventing that client from synchronizing its time. (CVE-2016-1547)\n\n* It was found that an ntpd client could be forced to change from basic client/server mode to the interleaved symmetric mode. A remote attacker could use a spoofed packet that, when processed by an ntpd client, would cause that client to reject all future legitimate server responses, effectively disabling time synchronization on that client. (CVE-2016-1548)\n\n* A flaw was found in the way NTP's libntp performed message authentication. An attacker able to observe the timing of the comparison function used in packet authentication could potentially use this flaw to recover the message digest. (CVE-2016-1550)\n\n* An out-of-bounds access flaw was found in the way ntpd processed certain packets. An authenticated attacker could use a crafted packet to create a peer association with hmode of 7 and larger, which could potentially (although highly unlikely) cause ntpd to crash.

kernel security, bug fix, and enhancement update (Moderate)","Summary":"The kernel packages contain the Linux kernel, the core of any Linux operating system.\n\nSecurity Fix(es):\n\n* It was discovered that a remote attacker could leverage the generation of IPv6 atomic fragments to trigger the use of fragmentation in an arbitrary IPv6 flow (in scenarios in which actual fragmentation of packets is not needed) and could subsequently perform any type of a fragmentation-based attack against legacy IPv6 nodes that do not implement RFC6946. (CVE-2016-10142, Moderate)\n\n* A flaw was discovered in the way the Linux kernel dealt with paging structures. When the kernel invalidated a paging structure that was not in use locally, it could, in principle, race against another CPU that is switching to a process that uses the paging structure in question. A local user could use a thread running with a stale cached virtual-\u003ephysical translation to potentially escalate their privileges if the translation in question were writable and the physical page got reused for something critical (for example, a page table). (CVE-2016-2069, Moderate)\n\n* A race condition flaw was found in the ioctl_send_fib() function in the Linux kernel's aacraid implementation. A local attacker could use this flaw to cause a denial of service (out-of-bounds access or system crash) by changing a certain size value. (CVE-2016-6480, Moderate)\n\n* It was found that when the gcc stack protector was enabled, reading the /proc/keys file could cause a panic in the Linux kernel due to stack corruption. This happened because an incorrect buffer size was used to hold a 64-bit timeout value rendered as weeks. (CVE-2016-7042, Moderate)\n\n* It was found that when file permissions were modified via chmod and the user modifying them was not in the owning group or capable of CAP_FSETID, the setgid bit would be cleared. Setting a POSIX ACL via setxattr sets the file permissions as well as the new ACL, but doesn't clear the setgid bit in a similar way. This could allow a local user to gain group privileges via certain setgid applications. (CVE-2016-7097, Moderate)\n\n* A flaw was found in the Linux networking subsystem where a local attacker with CAP_NET_ADMIN capabilities could cause an out-of-bounds memory access by creating a smaller-than-expected ICMP header and sending to its destination via sendto(). (CVE-2016-8399, Moderate)\n\n* It was found that the blk_rq_map_user_iov() function in the Linux kernel's block device implementation did not properly restrict the type of iterator, which could allow a local attacker to read or write to arbitrary kernel memory locations or cause a denial of service (use-after-free) by leveraging write access to a /dev/sg device. (CVE-2016-9576, CVE-2016-10088, Moderate)\n\n* A flaw was found in the USB-MIDI Linux kernel driver: a double-free error could be triggered for the 'umidi' object. An attacker with physical access to the system could use this flaw to escalate their privileges.

(CVE-2016-10142, Moderate)\n\n* A flaw was discovered in the way the Linux kernel dealt with paging structures. When the kernel invalidated a paging structure that was not in use locally, it could, in principle, race against another CPU that is switching to a process that uses the paging structure in question. A local user could use a thread running with a stale cached virtual-\u003ephysical translation to potentially escalate their privileges if the translation in question were writable and the physical page got reused for something critical (for example, a page table). (CVE-2016-2069, Moderate)\n\n* A race condition flaw was found in the ioctl_send_fib() function in the Linux kernel's aacraid implementation. A local attacker could use this flaw to cause a denial of service (out-of-bounds access or system crash) by changing a certain size value. (CVE-2016-6480, Moderate)\n\n* It was found that when the gcc stack protector was enabled, reading the /proc/keys file could cause a panic in the Linux kernel due to stack corruption. This happened because an incorrect buffer size was used to hold a 64-bit timeout value rendered as weeks. (CVE-2016-7042, Moderate)\n\n* It was found that when file permissions were modified via chmod and the user modifying them was not in the owning group or capable of CAP_FSETID, the setgid bit would be cleared. Setting a POSIX ACL via setxattr sets the file permissions as well as the new ACL, but doesn't clear the setgid bit in a similar way. This could allow a local user to gain group privileges via certain setgid applications. (CVE-2016-7097, Moderate)\n\n* A flaw was found in the Linux networking subsystem where a local attacker with CAP_NET_ADMIN capabilities could cause an out-of-bounds memory access by creating a smaller-than-expected ICMP header and sending to its destination via sendto(). (CVE-2016-8399, Moderate)\n\n* It was found that the blk_rq_map_user_iov() function in the Linux kernel's block device implementation did not properly restrict the type of iterator, which could allow a local attacker to read or write to arbitrary kernel memory locations or cause a denial of service (use-after-free) by leveraging write access to a /dev/sg device. (CVE-2016-9576, CVE-2016-10088, Moderate)\n\n* A flaw was found in the USB-MIDI Linux kernel driver: a double-free error could be triggered for the 'umidi' object. An attacker with physical access to the system could use this flaw to escalate their privileges.

kernel security, bug fix, and enhancement update (Moderate)","Summary":"The kernel packages contain the Linux kernel, the core of any Linux operating system.\n\nSecurity Fix(es):\n\n* It was discovered that a remote attacker could leverage the generation of IPv6 atomic fragments to trigger the use of fragmentation in an arbitrary IPv6 flow (in scenarios in which actual fragmentation of packets is not needed) and could subsequently perform any type of a fragmentation-based attack against legacy IPv6 nodes that do not implement RFC6946. (CVE-2016-10142, Moderate)\n\n* A flaw was discovered in the way the Linux kernel dealt with paging structures. When the kernel invalidated a paging structure that was not in use locally, it could, in principle, race against another CPU that is switching to a process that uses the paging structure in question. A local user could use a thread running with a stale cached virtual-\u003ephysical translation to potentially escalate their privileges if the translation in question were writable and the physical page got reused for something critical (for example, a page table). (CVE-2016-2069, Moderate)\n\n* A race condition flaw was found in the ioctl_send_fib() function in the Linux kernel's aacraid implementation. A local attacker could use this flaw to cause a denial of service (out-of-bounds access or system crash) by changing a certain size value. (CVE-2016-6480, Moderate)\n\n* It was found that when the gcc stack protector was enabled, reading the /proc/keys file could cause a panic in the Linux kernel due to stack corruption. This happened because an incorrect buffer size was used to hold a 64-bit timeout value rendered as weeks. (CVE-2016-7042, Moderate)\n\n* It was found that when file permissions were modified via chmod and the user modifying them was not in the owning group or capable of CAP_FSETID, the setgid bit would be cleared. Setting a POSIX ACL via setxattr sets the file permissions as well as the new ACL, but doesn't clear the setgid bit in a similar way. This could allow a local user to gain group privileges via certain setgid applications. (CVE-2016-7097, Moderate)\n\n* A flaw was found in the Linux networking subsystem where a local attacker with CAP_NET_ADMIN capabilities could cause an out-of-bounds memory access by creating a smaller-than-expected ICMP header and sending to its destination via sendto(). (CVE-2016-8399, Moderate)\n\n* It was found that the blk_rq_map_user_iov() function in the Linux kernel's block device implementation did not properly restrict the type of iterator, which could allow a local attacker to read or write to arbitrary kernel memory locations or cause a denial of service (use-after-free) by leveraging write access to a /dev/sg device. (CVE-2016-9576, CVE-2016-10088, Moderate)\n\n* A flaw was found in the USB-MIDI Linux kernel driver: a double-free error could be triggered for the 'umidi' object. An attacker with physical access to the system could use this flaw to escalate their privileges.

(CVE-2017-2636, Important)\n\n* A flaw was found in the Linux kernel's implementation of seq_file where a local attacker could manipulate memory in the put() function pointer. This could lead to memory corruption and possible privileged escalation.

This update fixes the kernel scheduler, and the kernel panic no longer occurs under the described circumstances. (BZ#1436241)\n\n* Previously, memory leak of the struct cred data structure and related data structures occasionally occurred. Consequently, system performance was suboptimal with the symptoms of high I/O operations wait and small amount of free memory. This update fixes the reference counter of the struct slab cache to no longer cause imbalance between the calls to the get_cred() function and the put_cred() function. As a result, the memory leak no longer occurs under the described circumstances. (BZ#1443234)\n\n* Previously, the be2net driver could not detect the link status properly on IBM Power Systems. Consequently, the link status was always reported as disconnected. With this update, be2net has been fixed, and the Network Interface Cards (NICs) now report the link status correctly. (BZ#1442979)\n\n* Previously, the RFF_ID and RFT_ID commands in the lpfc driver were issued in an incorrect order. Consequently, users were not able to access Logical Unit Numbers (LUNs). With this update, lpfc has been fixed to issue RFT_ID before RFF_ID, which is the correct order. As a result, users can now access LUNs as expected. (BZ#1439636)\n\n* Previously, the kdump mechanism was trying to get the lock by the vmalloc_sync_all() function during a kernel panic. Consequently, a deadlock occurred, and the crashkernel did not boot. This update fixes the vmalloc_sync_all() function to avoid synchronizing the vmalloc area on the crashing CPU. As a result, the crashkernel parameter now boots as expected, and the kernel dump is collected successfully under the described circumstances.

(CVE-2017-7895, Important)\n\nRed Hat would like to thank Ari Kauppi for reporting this issue.\n\nBug Fix(es):\n\n* If several file operations were started after a mounted NFS share had got idle and its Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) connection had therefore been terminated, these operations could cause multiple TCP SYN packets coming from the NFS client instead of one. With this update, the reconnection logic has been fixed, and only one TCP SYN packet is now sent in the described situation. (BZ#1450850)\n\n* When the ixgbe driver was loaded for a backplane-connected network card, a kernel panic could occur, because the ops.setup_fc function pointer was used before the initialization. With this update, ops.setup_fc is initialized earlier. As a result, ixgbe no longer panics on load. (BZ#1457347)\n\n* When setting an Access Control List (ACL) with 190 and more Access Control Entries (ACEs) on a NFSv4 directory, a kernel crash could previously occur. This update fixes the nfs4_getfacl() function, and the kernel no longer crashes under the described circumstances. (BZ#1449096)\n\n* When upgrading to kernel with the fix for stack guard flaw, a crash could occur in Java Virtual Machine (JVM) environments, which attempted to implement their own stack guard page. With this update, the underlying source code has been fixed to consider the PROT_NONE mapping as a part of the stack, and the crash in JVM no longer occurs under the described circumstances. (BZ#1466667)\n\n* When a program receives IPv6 packets using the raw socket, the ioctl(FIONREAD) and ioctl(SIOCINQ) functions can incorrectly return zero waiting bytes. This update fixes the ip6_input_finish() function to check the raw payload size properly. As a result, the ioctl() function now returns bytes waiting in the raw socket correctly. (BZ#1450870)\n\n* Previously, listing a directory on a non-standard XFS filesystem (with non-default multi-fsb directory blocks) could lead to a soft lock up due to array index overrun in the xfs_dir2_leaf_readbuf() function. This update fixes xfs_dir2_leaf_readbuf(), and the soft lock up no longer occurs under the described circumstances. (BZ#1445179)\n\n* Previously, aborts from the array after the Storage Area Network (SAN) fabric back-pressure led to premature reuse of still valid sequence with the same OX_ID. Consequently, an error message and data corruption could occur. This update fixes the libfc driver to isolate the timed out OX_IDs, thus fixing this bug. (BZ#1455550)\n\n* Previously, a kernel panic occurred when the mcelog daemon executed a huge page memory offline. This update fixes the HugeTLB feature of the Linux kernel to check for the Page Table Entry (PTE) NULL pointer in the page_check_address() function.
